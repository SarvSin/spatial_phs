## INTRODUCTION

An appropriate measure of hospitalisation risk due to COPD in a region is the standardised mortality rate (SMR). This metric is a ratio of observed over expected hospital admission counts. Expected hospital admission counts for each local authority (LA) are obtained by applying age-sex rates over England, to age-sex profile within each LA.  In this report, the regional and local authority-level distribution of hospitalisation risk due to COPD is explored, and recommendations for resource allocation are provided.

## RESULTS
To account for the influence of air quality, economy, demography, and lifestyle patterns of immediate geographical neighbours, ‘smoothed’ estimates of SMRs are calculated and analysed. The spatial mapping of these estimates (see Figure 1) suggests that the risk of COPD hospitalisation is relatively higher in the following regions in England – north, north-west, north-east, south-east. An absence of significant regional differences between raw and smoothed SMR estimates affirms the statistical significance of clustering of high-risk COPD regions in England. Even so, on a local authority-level significant changes in SMRs were observed for some members. 

Absolute differences between raw and smoothed SMRs are plotted in Figure 2. Particularly, the SMR for the City of London increased from 0.5 to 0.9 after accounting for high COPD admission rates in the neighbourhood counties. This result can be explained by the very small area of City of London, the UK’s smallest ceremonial county of size 2.90 km2. This small area creates a large sampling variability, since the SMR variance is found to be the highest at 0.017 (see Table 1).

Corby is another county where the difference between raw and smoothed SMRs is relatively large at 0.083. Like the City of London, sampling variability is found to be large at Corby considering a high SMR variance at 0.008. In both cases of City of London and Corby, the use of smoothed SMRs is much recommended as the problem of sampling variability due to small expected numbers is mitigated.

Rutland county has the second-largest difference between raw and smoothed SMRs after the City of London, yet sampling variability does not appear to be a cause for the same in this case. Because the expected number of cases is large, its SMR variance is not significantly high. However, the small size (382 km2) and population (323rd of 326 districts in population in England) imply that non-statistical issues might be worth noting. Unequal distribution, and even absence of certain age-sex groups in smaller areas can create bias in mortality rate calculation.

## CONCLUSION
Of the 139 districts where smoothed SMR is greater than 1, the majority are in metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West and South Yorkshire, and Tyne and Wear. It is recommended that resources be increased in hospitals in these boroughs to cope with higher-than-expected hospital admissions. Although risk of hospitalisation due to COPD is falling over all districts (see Figure 3), including the districts where smoothed SMR is greater than 1, and that SMR fell below 1.0 in 2008 – it is crucial to remember that the SMR for many districts remains greater than 1, and that an SMR metric is not without its limitations. Especially for small areas, the SMR ratio can be unstable due to both statistical issues and non-statistical issues. Smoothening the SMRs can help deal with statistical issues and reduce the size of standard errors, however a trade-off between larger and smaller areas of consideration needs to be managed in the case of potential non-statistical issues like aggregation and bias.
